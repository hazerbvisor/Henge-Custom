# Henge for iOS

The Henge app on HengeVM's engine. The installer lets you select a sparse
virtual disk of 64, 128 (default), 256, or 512 GiB before macOS restore. The
selected size is the logical maximum, not space preallocated on iPad storage.
Existing VM disks are not changed by this installer option.

Build: `ios/scripts/package_ipa.sh` (writes
`~/Desktop/Henge.ipa`; `--trollstore` writes `Henge.tipa`, for TrollStore and
TrollStore Lite, without the entitlements TrollStore bans). Needs Xcode 27 or later, xcodegen,
and the prebuilt pieces
`ios/scripts/fetch_deps.sh` copies from Husk (StikJIT, the pairing library,
libslirp and glib for iOS).

- **JIT**: on iOS 26+ (TXM) only an attached debugger can grant executable
  memory. Henge uses the same machinery as Husk: StikDebug, TrollStore, a
  jailbreak, or the built-in StikJIT helper (`HengeJITHelper.appex`, with
  on-device pairing on iOS 27). The app claims one 1 GB region per launch
  (`JITBootstrap.jitBytes`) and the engine writes through a `vm_remap`'d alias
  (`host/jit_region.c`, split mode).
- **Memory**: `increased-memory-limit` is recommended, not required. Once a
  debugger has attached, guest RAM is kept out of the app's memory limit, and if
  iOS refuses that it comes from a file on free storage instead.
- **Machines** are installed on the iPhone from Apple's restore image
  (`Installer.swift`, [docs/architecture.md](../docs/architecture.md)). A machine
  can also be exported from the app, or made on a Mac with
  `tools/export_ios.sh DISK AUX ECID [NAME]` (disk packed with its holes left out,
  see `host/hvsparse.h`), and dropped on Henge in Finder or picked in Files.
- **Boot ROM**: fetched from Apple at install, not shipped (`Henge/BootROM.swift`,
  [docs/architecture.md](../docs/architecture.md)).
- **Display**: iOS has no ParavirtualizedGraphics framework, so Henge replays the
  guest's GPU commands with Metal (`devices/pvg_lite.c`, `devices/pvg_metal.m`).
- **External display (iOS 27+)**: `SessionView` registers a SwiftUI
  `ExternalNonInteractiveAccessory` during a Mac session. `DisplayRouter` selects
  one live `CAMetalLayer`, preferring the external surface and returning to the
  device on disconnect. The phone's session owns the VM and all input; the
  accessory only presents pixels. The existing guest resolution is unchanged
  (1920×1080 by default on iPhone), fitted to the monitor without stretching.
  USB-C video and a hub's keyboard/mouse can be used together when iOS recognizes
  the peripherals. iOS 17–26 keep system mirroring; AirPlay may also provide an
  external scene, with transport-dependent latency. Run `make test-display-routing`
  for routing lifecycle checks; `ios/scripts/check_display.sh` also compiles all
  app Swift sources and the iOS/macOS renderer without linking external libraries.
  USB-C video is user-confirmed on an iPhone 17 Pro running iOS 27 with
  development build 0.1/2; activation is automatic during a Mac session.
  Remaining acceptance checks: connect before/during boot, unplug/replug with an
  idle desktop, rotate the phone, use keyboard/mouse through the dock, and end
  the session while connected. These individual lifecycle cases, other devices
  and AirPlay have not been separately verified.
- **Sharing** (`Henge/Sharing.swift`, `host/share.c`,
  [docs/architecture.md](../docs/architecture.md)): the Shared folder in Files and
  the clipboard. The Mac's clipboard follows along; going the other way uses the
  system paste button, since iOS asks permission when an app reads it on its own.
- **Hardware input** (`Henge/Hardware.swift`): a keyboard's keys go to the Mac's
  USB keyboard by HID usage, which is how iOS reports them. A trackpad or mouse
  goes through GameController with the pointer locked, which iPadOS allows only
  for an app filling the screen. The first scroll values are logged to
  `henge.log`, to tune scrolling from a real device.
- **Chips**: the virtual CPU offers Armv8.5 instructions (`core/sysreg.c`), which
  macOS uses and which run as they are, so Henge needs an A14 or M1 or newer.
